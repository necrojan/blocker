# Blocker

This is a simple desktop app that blocks websites, to avoid 
distractions while working. This app is incomplete as I was just practicing to use JS and Electron.

### Todo
<ul>
  <li>Display the listed site aside from having a notification</li>
  <li>Add a script that will run a command for having admin privileges instead of 
  manually adding permissions on the hosts file.</li>
</ul>
